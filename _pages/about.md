**Envision the whole of you.** 

<span style="font-size: 1.1em;">CS Ph.D. candidate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1.1em;">Welcome! I'm Zhen Zhu, a final year Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), working with Professor [Derek Hoiem](https://dhoiem.cs.illinois.edu/). I received my Master's degree from [HUST](http://english.hust.edu.cn/) in June 2020, supervised by Professor [Xiang Bai](https://xbai.vlrlab.net). 
</span>
<!-- Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, HUST in 2017.  -->

<span style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1.1em;">
<!-- My research lies at the intersection of  -->
<!-- <b>continual and dynamic learning</b>, <b>multimodal learning</b>, and  -->
<!-- <b>controllable image synthesis</b>.  -->
My goal is to develop adaptive and trustworthy learning systems that <b>adapt continuously</b>, <b>reason across modalities</b>, and <b>remain under human control</b>.
</span>

### Research Focus
{: #research-focus}
- **Continual & Dynamic Learning** — algorithms that update in real time without forgetting.  
- **Multimodal Learning** — large vision-language models that integrate images, text, video, and more.  
- **Controllable Image Synthesis** — diffusion-based tools for fast, precise and user-directed editing.

### Recent Highlights
{: #recent-highlights}
- **Forgetting in large multimodal models.** New work shows that tuning a small set of layers in a LMM adds skills with almost no forgetting and zero past data.
- **Anytime Continual Learning** lets open-vocabulary classifiers absorb new examples in milliseconds while retaining zero-shot scope.
- **Instant/geometry-aware diffusion editing** enables few-step, training-free image manipulation on edge devices.  


<!-- <span style="font-weight: 300; font-size: 1.1em;">My current research interests include creating <b>efficient and dynamic learning systems</b>, <b>vision-language models</b>, <b>generative models</b>, and more.</span> -->

<!-- **This is my final year of Ph.D. study. I am currently on the job market, seeking mostly PostDocs or suitable faculty positions starting in Fall 2025.** If you find my research interests and background align with potential opportunities, or if you'd like to discuss collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email. I'm excited about the prospect of contributing to academic institutions and fostering innovative research in cognitive science, computer vision and robotics. -->
